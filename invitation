Dear,

It is perhaps a pure coincident to meet you, but we are glad that you generously borrow your heart to lemon for the next two hours in this workshop. I am sure you smell almost like summer now.

Lemon, understood as mysterious mistakes by a mutual agreement in a random conversation, has generated a lot of suspicious encounters among things and people.

It is the ambiguous voice between potato and pancake, power and plant, or tea and teeth. It is the magic side product of dancing consciousness, or the consequence of a network of unexpected relationships. We’ve prepared a series of exercises crafted for those who embrace arbitrary games and enjoy accident economy, and hope your mind is ready to sail on a ripe horizon.

We will play, but it is not yet a play. It is script writing. By entering it, you are writing a future exhibition by stretching your sensibility, imagination and communication skills. You will be speaking an unheard language, and turning into a blue crocodile, an octopus chef, a girl with moustache, a champaign barrel or a silky mushroom.

Let’s lemon! We shall lick the wrong ones before the dawn.

Sourly Slippery,

Grape Fruitis, Cocolut and Kiwi Na
